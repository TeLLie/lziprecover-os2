.SH NAME
lziprecover \- recovers data from damaged lzip files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lziprecover
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the lzip
compressed data format (.lz). Lziprecover is able to repair slightly damaged
files, produce a correct file by merging the good parts of two or more
damaged copies, extract data from damaged files, decompress files and test
integrity of files.
.PP
Lziprecover can repair perfectly most files with small errors (up to one
single\-byte error per member), without the need of any extra redundance
at all. Losing an entire archive just because of a corrupt byte near the
beginning is a thing of the past.
.PP
Lziprecover can remove the damaged members from multimember files, for
example multimember tar.lz archives.
.PP
Lziprecover provides random access to the data in multimember files; it only
decompresses the members containing the desired data.
.PP
Lziprecover facilitates the management of metadata stored as trailing data
in lzip files.
.PP
Lziprecover is not a replacement for regular backups, but a last line of
defense for the case where the backups are also damaged.

If no file names are given, or if a file is '\-', lziprecover decompresses
from standard input to standard output.
Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000,
Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...
.PP
Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused lziprecover to panic.
