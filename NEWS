The option '-F, --fec', which implements Forward Error Correction (FEC), has
been added.

The options '-0' to '-9' (FEC fragmentation level) have been added.

'-i' is given.

When decompressing or testing, lziprecover now exits with error status 2 if
the first byte of the LZMA stream is not 0 unless '-i' is given.

The option '--clear-marking' has been renamed to '--nonzero-repair'.

Options '--empty-error' and '--marking-error' have been removed.

The chapter 'Syntax of command-line arguments' has been added to the manual.
