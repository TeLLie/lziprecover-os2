Changes in version 1.23:

Decompression time has been reduced by 5-12% depending on the file.

In case of error in a numerical argument to a command line option, lziprecover
now shows the name of the option and the range of valid values.

Options '--dump' and '--strip' now refuse to write compressed data to a
terminal except when dumping trailing data with '--dump=tdata'.

The option '-U, --unzcrash' now requires an argument: '1' to test 1-bit
errors, or 'B<size>' to test zeroed blocks.

The memory tester now allocates the dictionary once per member instead of
doing it for each test. This makes '-U, --unzcrash' about two times faster
on my machine on files with an uncompressed size larger than about 30 MB.

'-W, --debug-decompress' now continues decompressing the members following
the damaged member if it has been fully decompressed (just failed with a CRC
mismatch).

The tool unzcrash now uses execvp instead of popen to avoid invoking /bin/sh
and run faster. It also prints byte or block position in messages.

Several descriptions have been improved in manual, '--help', and man page.

The texinfo category of the manual has been changed from 'Data Compression'
to 'Compression' to match that of gzip. (Reported by Alfred M. Szmidt).
