Changes in version 1.24:

The option '--empty-error', which forces exit status 2 if any empty member
is found, has been added.

The option '--marking-error', which forces exit status 2 if the first LZMA
byte is non-zero in any member, has been added.

The option '--clear-marking', which sets to zero the first LZMA byte of each
member, has been added.

The keyword 'empty' is now recognized in the argument of '--dump',
'--remove', and '--strip'.

The option '--repair' has been renamed to '--byte-repair'.

The option '--debug-repair' has been renamed to '--debug-byte-repair'.

File diagnostics have been reformatted as 'PROGRAM: FILE: MESSAGE'.

Diagnostics caused by invalid arguments to command-line options now show the
argument and the name of the option.

The option '-o, --output' now preserves dates, permissions, and ownership of
the file, when decompressing exactly one file.

The option '-o, --output' now creates missing intermediate directories when
writing to a file.

The option '--no-verify' of unzcrash has been renamed to '--no-check'.

The variable MAKEINFO has been added to configure and Makefile.in.

The makefile target 'install-as-lzip' has been removed because '--reproduce'
needs a lzip compressor (not just a decompressor) named 'lzip' by default.
